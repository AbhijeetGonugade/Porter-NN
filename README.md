# Porter-NN
Process 
1. Import the data and understand the structure of the data: • usual exploratory 
analysis steps like checking the structure & characteristics of the dataset 
2. Data preprocessing • Cleaning of data • Feature engineering: Creating the target 
column time taken in each delivery from order timestamp (created_at) and 
delivery timestamp (actual_delivery_time) • Getting hour of day from the order 
time and also the day of the week • Understanding pandas datetime data type 
and what function it provides by default • Get delivery time in minutes 
3. Handling null values 
4. Encoding categorical columns 
5. Data visualization and cleaning • Visualize various columns for better 
understanding Countplots, scatterplots 
6. Check if the data contains outliers • Removing outliers by any method • Plotting 
the data again to see if anything has improved 
7. Split the data in train and test 
8. Scaling the data for neural networks. 
9. Creating a simple neural network • Trying different configurations • 
Understanding different activation functions, optimizers and other 
hyperparameters. 
10. Training the neural network for required amount of epochs 
11. Plotting the losses and checking the accuracy of the model 
12. Checking its various metrics like MSE, RMSE, MAE
